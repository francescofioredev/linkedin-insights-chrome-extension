# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a **private** security report (GitHub Security Advisory / email) instead of a public issue:

- Email: francesco.fiore.dev@gmail.com
- Include steps to reproduce, affected files, and potential impact.

We do not operate any servers and do not collect user data; issues are limited to client-side code execution and permission scope.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, non-destructive testing performed on local copies of the extension, provided you:

- Respect user privacy and do not exfiltrate any data.
- Refrain from DoS or disruption of third-party services.
- Give us reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure.
